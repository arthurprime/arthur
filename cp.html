          <h5>how to make it</h5>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>step 1:</strong> Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels and season with Italian seasoning. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
          <li><strong>step 2:</strong>Combine 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter in a large, non-stick skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
          <li><strong>step 3:</strong>When oil is hot and butter is bubbling, add chicken thighs and cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Turn chicken, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until juices no longer run pink, about 5 minutes more.  An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
          <li><strong>step 4:</strong>Remove chicken from the skillet, place on a serving platter, and keep warm.</li>
          <li><strong>step 5:</strong>To the same pan, over medium high heat, add remaining olive oil and butter, and allow butter to melt. Stir in onions and red pepper flakes and cook 1 to 2 minutes, then add mushrooms and bell peppers. Cook an additional 2 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
          <li><strong>step 6:</strong>Add broccoli florets, zucchini, and carrots. Cook, stirring, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
          <li><strong>step 7:</strong> asparagus, tomatoes, and garlic; cook until garlic is fragrant, about a minute.</li>
          <li><strong>step 8</strong>Pour in chicken broth and allow to come to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and stir in peas. When broth is lightly bubbling, add cream slowly, stirring, and stir in Parmesan cheese.</li>
          <li><strong>step 9:</strong>To serve place 2 chicken thighs on each plate and top with vegetables and Parmesan cream. Garnish with fresh flat-leaf parsley. Serve warm.</li>
